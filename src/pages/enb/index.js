                The Problem
              </h3>
              <p className="enb-body">
                Online and hybrid STEM courses ask students to self-regulate
                learning with far less day-to-day interaction and feedback than
                face-to-face classes.
              </p>
              <p className="enb-body">
                Organized study habits are essential, yet research cited in our ASEE
                work-in-progress shows that <b>49% of online students do not take
                notes</b>, and roughly <b>70% do not complete course readings</b>.
                Even after strong study-method workshops, many students find the
                methods time-consuming and hard to apply.
              </p>
              <p className="enb-body">
                Students already juggle apps, videos, social media, homework banks,
                tutoring services, and AI tools but few tools help them observe,
                evaluate, and adjust how they learn over a full term.

                The Solution
              </h3>
              <p className="enb-body">
                We built eNotebook as a web-based notebook that combines note-taking,
                an AI tutor, and study artifacts under one roof - shaped by feedback
                from <b>100+ university students</b>, including learners who use
                Disability Access Services.

                <li>
                  <b>Action:</b> We shipped Jarvis - an audio-to-text / text-to-audio
                  conversation feature powered by a ChatGPT engine, with activation
                  words and voice options students can customize.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Result:</b> Learners can talk through material (for example,

                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Action:</b> eNotebook supports typed and handwritten notes
                  (handwriting to text), cloud-stored images/audio/video/links, and a
                  menu of <b>50+ popular study apps</b> identified by students -
                  favorites rise to the top.
                </li>

                  <b>Result:</b> One web-accessible workspace on PC, Mac, phone, or

                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Action:</b> We generate AI study guides, flashcards, and practice
                  assessments - including how/why checks timed and remembered for
                  progress reporting - and keep interaction memory across the term
                  so personalization can improve.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Result:</b> Students revisit structured artifacts and practice
                  over any date range of their interactions, not just a disposable
                  chat thread.
